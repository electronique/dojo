    <h2>What is Git</h2>
    Git is a version control system; you can think of it as a series of snapshots
    (commits) of your code base. With the creation of each snapshot you build out a
    whole application, seeing the growth of a full app. During this time you can make branches
    to experiment and come back to a previous snapshot you took or merge those experiments into <thead>
      app.
    <h2>What is Github</h2>
    Github is a code hosting platform for version control
    and collaboration. It lets you and others work together
    on projects from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took
    during development.

        <h2>Git init</h2>
        Git init is the act of registering this current code base.
      </div>
      <div class="gitbasic1">
        <h2>Git add</h2>
        Git add is how we stage the intergration of our current code base into our current list of snapshots
      </div>

        <h2>Git status</h2>
        Git status allows us to see the changes we are going to make

      <div class="gitbasic2">
        <h2>Git commit</h2>
        Git commit; finally we can commit those changes we added to our last snapshot
      giving us a new snapshot of our code with whatever new changes were made</div>
      <div class="gitbasic2">
        <h2>Git remote add</h2>
        Git remote add is used to set up a online respository where we can place all of our current code. This is where the outside world can see our code base.

      <div class="gitbasic3">
        <h2>Git push</h2>
        Git push is how we get our code to Github, an excellent place to store all of our repositories. Other developers
        might look at our existing projects to see how we approached problems, pull down our code and addnew features or even update our
        code base with features they wanted to add.
